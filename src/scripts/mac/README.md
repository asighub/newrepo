## macOS Scripts

In this folder should go the scripts to install, compile and run the project in macOS, but... I do not have a Mac (so poor FeelsBadMan) so the scripts are the same as those of Linux.

Please do not hesitate to do a PR if you have a Mac and you can correct these files!

**âš  Note:**

Torch in macOS does not support CUDA. If you want to obtain GPU processing compability you will have to compile [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) yourself.
